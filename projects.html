											<p>The members reached River Gambhir bank and immediately realized that the river was in immediate need of care and attention.
											Algal bloom had massively deteriorated the water as the river was highly polluted. We already had the map and with the help of which, we surveyed all the way and discussed ways to clean the river, preserve its quality and prevent future deterioration.
											We later prepared a report concluding our survey. Rtd. Wing Commander Colonel PPS Kawatra guided us throughout the project.

											With the help of Mr. Nitin Patidar IAS, CEO Zila Parishad, we got an approval to meet Mrs. Neha Meena, IAS, CEO Zila Parishad, Indore (M.P).
											We presented our report to her and proposed our ideas about cleaning, beautification and preservation of River Gambhir. 
											She not only appreciated our initiative but also sanctioned the project with a promise to take immediate measures in order to control the increased pollution and depleting Ground Water.

											<p>The foundational team was ever-so excited to serve the society after coming together as the first Rotaract Club of Mhow, in years. The aim was to begin the journey with an act of giving back to those who live by the other side of the mountain, who receive lesser sunlight than the rest of the world and still find happiness in scarcity. It was important to instill this sense of empathy as a permanent part in the society and in the deepest of our sentiments.
											People across the town were asked to donate apparel like clothes, jackets, woolens, shoes, socks and  anything else they’d like to donate, stationary items and books for children. It was well known to us that St. Mary’s Higher Secondary school, Mhow organises similar donations around the time. Thereby we collaborated with them and helped them distribute their huge collection along with tour collection. Members of Rotary Club donated newly brought clothes, stationary items and much more. 
											The day of donation drive finally arrived, there was a very refreshing weather, with no sunlight, just cold wind and blissful drizzles of rain. We gathered at Chopra Vatika, Mhow as decided. Some members started folding and arranging clothes in the order of increasing age.
											Meanwhile other members were arranging food, water and other necessities. Some of the members decided to travel the way in car and the others in an open-roofed vehicle. As stated by the members who travelled in the open roofed vehicle, they never had such an experience with occasional showers of rain and chilling wind as they all hide under the huge waterproof cover while travelling. We stopped by any hut or village  where there can be children/old citizens in need. After distributing and spreading happiness at one place, we moved on to another. We covered 4-5 rural areas and distributed all what we had. We left the areas with an empty truck, but also with a heart laden with joy and warmth.  </p>

											<p>Rotary international and all its districts have been working for a period of more than 30 years, on a mission to permanently eradicate polio from the world. 
											It was the chilling month of January, when Rotary clubs across India were organising Immunization camps to provide vaccination against the Polio Virus. Under the same umbrella, Rotaractors and Rotarians of Mhow Community came together to organize a polio immunization camp in Mhow. 
											For the sake of availability to maximum number of people, we chose a central spot in the market place to set up the camp. Some of us attended and registered the incoming people, while the rest vaccinated their children. We put a black mark on a finger of those vaccinated. A lot of people attended and got their children vaccinated. The members felt great on realizing that they have contributed to such a project which aims at preventing and eradicating a painful disease. The camp taught us a lot and was a wonderful experience for all of us. Soon after completing the immunization, the members went to survey River Gambhir, on the same day, for a coming project on River Cleaning, River Beautification and River sustenance.  </p>

											<p>Cleanliness is not a virtue to be only practiced for the sake of dignity but also because we care for our world and all its biotic as well as abiotic components.
											Thought cleanliness is taught as part of curriculum in schools from early classes but somehow we fail to bring those teachings into practise. 
											That has proven to be critical in every way possible. We felt that we should try to spread awareness regarding the same, consistently for a long period. 
											We started our initiative by conducting a drawing and painting competition on the theme cleanliness, for classes 6th -8th (3 sections each) at Rajeshwar H. Sec. School, Mhow.
											We had made prior arrangements like creating a list of participating students, selecting the hall where the competition would be conducted, providing a letterhead to the school, printing certificates, buying sheets and prizes etc. 
											On the same day of the meeting with Mrs. Neha Meena, IAS, CEO Zila Parishad, Indore (M.P), half of members arrived at the location and made prior arrangements.
											A one or two Rotaractors took the responsibility to bring the children from the nine classes, one class at a time. We took the attendance of the participants, conducted the competition in less than two and a half hours, judged the paintings and provided the certificates and prizes to the school Principal Rev. Fr. Jollichan P.J., so that he can award the winners in the morning assembly. 
											The day was truly blissful for all of us as we had completed the cleanliness competition and also got the river cleaning project sanctioned  </p>

											<p>Greater the global advancement, greater is the pace required for some communities to walk shoulder to shoulder with the world. It is imperative that the communities with privilege help the ones with lesser priviledge. Recent technological advancements talk about artificial intelligence and automation. But some people in the world struggle to even understand, how can a mouse be used to control a human made computer?
											To fill a little of this gap, our members decided to conduct teaching-sessions for children at Massihi school in Umariya.  The members went to the school with their laptops and delivered theoretical as well as practical teachings about- Computer Fundaments, I/O devices, Components of a computer, MS Office, benefits of computers, present scenario, etc. The Sessions went very smoothly and were very interactive. 
											Children really enjoyed and seemed happy to learn about computers. Demonstrations were first given collectively to all students and then they were personally assisted. Children were at last told to operate computer under the supervision of our members. Attendees quickly grasped the practical implications of the freshly delivered lectures. The project comes under Prime Minister Grameen Saaksharta Abhiyan.
											It was an amazing experience having to teach for such a cause which should enable children with lesser privilege to have a  platform which would definitely help them with future education.

											<p>With ongoing social matters we considered it necessary to organize a self-defence seminar for children especially girls, that if unfortunately they come across any person who tries to harm them, they can protect themselves when alone. 
											As the Indian Penal Code also justifies acts done in private defence in its Chapter IV (General Exceptions) sections 96-106, we found it necessary and just to have a seminar on self-defence.
											Gyanodaya school of Mhow, agreed to provide a hall for hosting the program. Gyanodaya School provides education to children living in a typical slum type locality which is situated very close to the school. 
											Sir Manoj Bajaj, chairman of MP karate association, addressed the event and gave vigorous demonstration of techniques used for self-defence.
											He was assisted by his students in the live demonstration. Rtd. Wing Commander Colonel PPS Kawatra was the guest of honour who encouraged children to pursue aviation if they want to and that they shouldn’t surrender to any circumstance. 
											He also threw light on various governmental schemes regarding the same. 
											It was a bright sunny day of Winter, just appropriate enough for a self-defence seminar to be conducted. The hall was huge, we slowly brought all tables and chairs out of it, unrolled 2 or 3 rugs, cleaned the hall a bit and decorated the black board.
											We made the children sit in arrays separated according to height and age. Moreover, team volunteered to maintain a code of conduct and discipline throughout the session. Sir Manoj Bajaj with his students placed a vigorous demonstration infront of the students and also asked them to follow the instruction.
											The session finished very smoothly. The students and our team learned a lot about self defence and aviation. Rtd. Wing Commander Colonel PPS Kawatra Sir addressed Rotaractors after the session, and recalled old memories of his service in the Indian Air Force and filled our hearts with motivation and energy.
